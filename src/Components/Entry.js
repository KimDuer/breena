        <p className='entry' style={paragraphStyle}>So she left... She just left... And that was it... <br />

<br/>There was maybe a time in my life where I believed anything could happen. I'm not sure I could even place when anymore. Such frivolous dreams I could cling to for such a short time in life. <br />

<br/>Faith breaks, perhaps not so easily, but when it does there is little point left. For most, it is the cornerstone of their entire existence and even the slightest shift in knowledge to the contrary of said faith or beliefs send their lives reeling out of control. Hitting the bottom they are crippled by shock and injury that many choose never to move on from. Others, of course, dig a trench and cling to the old belief that will now never again have its tangibility. <br />

<br/>That quick snap to the ground no one could see beneath, was where I found true solidity. <br />

<br/>It was painful, one of the most painful things I had ever experienced. Pain though, has a funny way of making one see clearer. <br />

<br/>I think it bothered me alot that she knew such pain. Even though I know it made her all the better, I can feel it seep on rare occasions and it is so very intense. <br />

<br/>She navigated the bottom like a dream. So effortless, so graceful. As if she never fell and perhaps could never. A true goddess of such a forsaken place. 
I had the idea of catching her. Oh how naive that thought was, as if a being like her could ever belong to someone else. Just to have her as a part of my story, let alone to be involved in hers has put meaning on my life I could have never even honestly hoped for. I will always feel I owe her more than I can give. <br />

<br/>After watching from afar for such a time, I gathered enough to approach her with really little to no plan at all. I think the awe was enough to move me this time, mixed with a yearning for something I didn't yet know.<br />

<br/>I must have looked like the most awkward creature in all of existence at that point. Slinking, slithering, then suddenly strolling along. 
She glanced at me once, with the utmost curiosity in her eyes, then her eyes darted quickly away. I saw the edge of a grin as she turned away and I felt a warmth I never had before. It stayed for a while like a lit coal. <br />

<br/>She danced away with the shadows, piroetting as they lifted her ever so gently to the sky and down again. Oblivion flirted with her, beckoning her to where ever is after here. She barely batted an eye.<br />

<br/>The though had dawned on me, whether or not she was even human. Not that it entirely mattered either way. She could’ve been a demon and I would have seen her nothing short of an angelic being!<br />
I continued on my way in the place, though she always seemed to flow in and out of the picture. And I couldn’t help but stare every time she caught the corner of my eye. This eventually leading to my fall. A literal trip, right in a puddle, in fact. I repeat, akward creature.  One that could not escape her own vision, apparently. <br />

<br/>I looked up to see her above me, offering a hand of glowing ivory, dusted by rose petals. I was afraid to even touch it lest I taint it with myself.  <br />

<br/>She giggled faintly at my hesitation and finally grabbed my hand refusing me the choice. Her touch 
She had far more strength than I had anticipated and pulled me to my feet with little effort from me and from the looks of it, little effort from her. <br />

<br/>“What is your name?” <br />

<br/>Her voice was so peaceful, yet sensual, and lingered in the air like a soft breeze in spring. I stuttered awed my by the sound as much as her face. Glistening green sea glass stared back at me, morphing into the lightest and deepest greens of the forest, speckled with a spectrum of browns.<br />
 
<br/>“My name?”<br />

<br/>“Yes. You have one don’t you?” <br />

<br/>She giggled again more playfully than before.The wind blew her hair my direction wafting, somehow, the crisp scent of the ocean shore at sunrise.<br />

<br/>“Well, of course, (). My name is ().”<br />

<br/>“How peculiar! Strong yet mysterious. So tell me (), are you much like your name?” <br />

<br/>Her eyes piercing straight through me yet filled with a child-like curiosity. <br />

<br/>“I dont suppose I have ever really thought about it..”
